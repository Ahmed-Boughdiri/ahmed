### Tshilila Coin

In the realm of blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps), 
my journey as a full-stack developer led me to embark on an exciting endeavor called "Tshilila Coin." 
This groundbreaking web3 project aimed to revolutionize online marketplaces by introducing a novel concept - 
a platform exclusively dedicated to buying and selling items using the native cryptocurrency, Tshilila Coin (TSHIL). 
Though the project did not come to fruition, the experience proved to be an invaluable learning opportunity, 
providing deep insights into the world of blockchain technology and dApp development.
